kmeans	10	Purple	2	CGA	9606.ENSP00000482232	Glycoprotein hormones alpha chain; Shared alpha chain of the active heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones thyrotropin/thyroid stimulating hormone/TSH, lutropin/luteinizing hormone/LH, follitropin/follicle stimulating hormone/FSH and choriogonadotropin/CG. These hormones bind specific receptors on target cells that in turn activate downstream signaling pathways.
kmeans	10	Purple	2	HARS1	9606.ENSP00000425634	Histidine--tRNA ligase, cytoplasmic; Catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of histidine to the 3'- end of its cognate tRNA, via the formation of an aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate (His-AMP). Plays a role in axon guidance ; Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family.
